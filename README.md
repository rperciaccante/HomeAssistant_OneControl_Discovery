HomeAssistant_OneControl_Discovery
=========================================

### About

This is a project that is designed to utilize Node Red to connect to your Lippert OneControl cloud bridge and download the entities into your Home Assistant instance, allowing you to control most items in your RV.

This has been tested on my 2021 Grand Design Momentum 397TH-R.  Additional samples are always appreciated.

Limitations:
- Physical devices such as slides and awnings are NOT currently supported due to the complexity of the integration and the risks associated with the potential for damage.
